##Overview of the project:
##project: simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. 
Obective:the objective of implementing linear regression is to learn the linear relationship between variables, 
train a model to capture this relationship, evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data, and visualize
the model’s accuracy and predictive performance.
Key Activities:
1.Dataset Collection and Loading:Obtain a dataset where the target variable is continuous, and load it into the working environment (e.g., using pandas for CSV files).
2. Data Preprocessing:Prepare the dataset for model training by cleaning, selecting features, and splitting the data.
3. Model Training:Train the linear regression model on the training data.
4.Make Predictions: Predict target values using the test set.
5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using MSE and R-squared.
6.Visualization: Visualize the regression line and compare actual vs predicted values to assess model accuracy visually.
##Technologies used:
1.Python: Core language used for implementation.
2.Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
3.NumPy: For numerical operations.
4.scikit-learn: For model training, data splitting, and performance evaluation.
5.Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the regression line and prediction results.
6.Jupyter Notebook: For coding and documenting in an interactive manner.
